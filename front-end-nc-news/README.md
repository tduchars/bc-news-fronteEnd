## NC News FrontEnd

follow the readme instructions to easily run the project locally.

To run this file locally you will need to run the command to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

## Dependencies

The package versions I developed the site on can be seen below:

```js
"dependencies": {
    "@reach/router": "^1.2.1",
    "axios": "^0.19.0",
    "react": "^16.11.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.11.0",
    "react-scripts": "3.2.0",
    "react-toastify": "^5.4.0"
  }
```

(If you have any issues check you are running versions of these
dependencies which will support the functionality.)

## ** Recommended **

Given that this is a portfolio piece I added some logged in and not logged in user functionality. If you log in with a valid username that is on the database (no password is required!) Then you are given the functionality to add comments and vote on articles.

If you are not "logged in" then this functionality is removed.
